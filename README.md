See what was tweeted about the movie you're watching and join the conversation.

# How does it work?

In two ways:
- It watches your Twitter stream and whenever you tweet something while you're watching the movie, a screenshot and your tweet are captured.
- For every movie you start watching, the service looks if anyone has tweeted anything while [i]he[/i] (or [i]she[/i]) was watching it, and it shows the tweet on your screen at the moment that tweet was sent [i]in the movie[/i].

The tweets (and screenshots) are collected at http://46.101.159.192/ (yeah, I still need a domain).

# Installation

Simply install from zip -- you can find the package [on the releases page](https://github.com/LaundroMat/kodi-screentalk/releases/).

# Final remarks

Yes, the code is a big mess. It was an even bigger mess before (it grew out of something I just wanted to try), so there's bound to be plenty of stuff that'll go wrong. I also haven't tested it on anything else than Kodi 14 on Windows 7.

Please report bugs (with logs!) [in this thread on the Kodi forum](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=229861) or log an issue here. I can't guarantee I'll speedily fix things though; this is a spare time project and a) I have many of those b) but never enough spare time.

Enjoy! I'm curious to see what'll happen of this :)
